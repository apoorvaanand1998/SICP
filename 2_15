Yes, she is right. From Ex 2.13 we can see that during
the multiplication of two intervals, their error perc-
entages are added.

The more number of uncertain variables in an algebraic
expression, the larger the error percentages will be.
Every "unnecessary" multiplication, will increase the
width of the values, and although the final center
value might be the same in the end, the width of the
resultant interval would be much more.

Thus par2 is the "better" program for parallel
resistances.
