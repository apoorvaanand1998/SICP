Let's consider two intervals

A = 7.92, 8.08 = 8, 1%
B = 12.74, 13.26 = 13, 2%

Calculating parallel resistance, we get

par1 = 4.72, 5.18 = 4.95, 4.64%
par2 = 4.88, 5.02 = 4.95, 1.41%

As we can see, Lem is right.

Similarly, let's compute A / A and A / B

(div-interval A A) = 1, 2%
(div-interval A B) = 0.61, 3%

As we can see, when one does A / A,
they get 1 but also with the error percentage of 2%.

This happens because during the computation, the
error percentage get added (Ex 2.13).
