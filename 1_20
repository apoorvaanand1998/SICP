After using the substitution model and evaluating (gcd 206 40) we normal order evaluation, we see that there are 17 remainder operations as opposed to the 4 we have to do in applicative order evaluation.

(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
(gcd (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
