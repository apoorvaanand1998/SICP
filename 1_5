In applicative order, since the expressions are evaluated first (to the extent that they can be), and then substituted, the (test 0 (p)) would lead to an infinite loop/recursion because of the (p) being evaluated first.

Whereas in normal order evaluation, since they are first expanded, eventually the if expression in test would disregard the (p) and we would get an answer of 0.
